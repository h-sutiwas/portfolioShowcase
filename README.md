## Education
B.E., Civil Engineering | Chulalongkorn University (_July 2020_ - _June 2024_)

## Work Experience
**Volunteered Research Assistant (_July 2024_ - _February 2025_)**
- Conducted data cleansing and data imputation as preprocessing steps for traffic sensor data before performing clustering analysis using **Python**.
- Utilize **R** **Affinity Propagation** model with Negative Euclidean function and Normalized Correlation as similarity matrices for traffic pattern clustering and report in cluster of sensor points.

## Projects
### Development of Activity Inference Model by Machine Learning Method
[Publication](https://civil.eng.chula.ac.th/Data_Upload/Senior%20project/2023/TR_2023/Y2023_TR_Article_G02.pdf)

Utilized **R** and **Excel Pivot Tables** for data cleansing, data preprocessing and descriptive analysis with visualization to analyze travel patterns by different parameters then normalized features to aligned variable formats between survey data and mobile signal data. Developed, trained models and compare two classification models (**Random Forest** and **Naive Bayes Classifier**) in R which applied 80/20 train test split of which Random Forest outperformed Naive Bayes across all metrics. Results demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning to reduce dependency on costly travel surveys while maintaining high predictive accuracy for transportation planning applications.
